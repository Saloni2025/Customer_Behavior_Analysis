Data Analytics Project
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from data ingestion and exploration to database querying, visualization, and reporting. The goal is to extract actionable insights from raw data and present them clearly through dashboards and presentations.

The project covers:

Data loading and preprocessing in Python

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning and transformation

SQL querying across multiple database systems

Dashboard development in Power BI

Insight reporting and presentation creation

Dataset

Source: (Add source or note if synthetic/private)

Format: CSV / Excel (as applicable)

Description:
The dataset contains structured records used to analyze trends, patterns, and key performance metrics relevant to the business or problem context.

Tools & Technologies

Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Databases:

PostgreSQL

MySQL

SQL Server

Data Visualization: Power BI

Reporting: Power BI Report

Presentation: Gamma (PPT-style presentation)

Project Steps

Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Performed initial data inspection and validation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data structure, distributions, and relationships.

Identified missing values, outliers, and anomalies.

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Handled missing and inconsistent values.

Standardized formats and created derived features where needed.

Database Integration & SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.

Wrote SQL queries to:

Aggregate metrics

Identify trends

Answer key business questions

Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Visualized KPIs, trends, and comparisons for stakeholders.

Reporting & Presentation

Created a structured analytical report.

Designed a presentation using Gamma to communicate insights clearly.

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trend analysis over time

Filters for dynamic exploration

Clear, stakeholder-friendly visualizations

(Add screenshots or a link to the dashboard if available)

Results & Insights

Identified key trends and patterns within the data.

Highlighted actionable insights supported by SQL and visual analysis.

Delivered findings in both dashboard and presentation formats for decision-making.
